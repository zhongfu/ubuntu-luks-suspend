ubuntu-luks-suspend
====================

A script for [Ubuntu][] to lock the encrypted root volume on suspend.

When using [dm-crypt with LUKS][] to set up full system encryption, the
encryption key is kept in memory when suspending the system. This drawback
defeats the purpose of encryption if you carry around your suspended laptop
a lot. One can use the `cryptsetup luksSuspend` command to freeze all I/O and
flush the key from memory, but special care must be taken when applying it to
the root device.

The `ubuntu-linux-suspend` script replaces the default suspend mechanism of
systemd. It extracts the initramfs to RAM and changes root to it in order to
perform the `luksSuspend`, actual suspend, and `luksResume` operations.
